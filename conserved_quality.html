<h1>Cellular Doodles</h1>
<p>
  A short list of block cellular automata demonstrations.
  <!-- TODO: link -->
</p>
<p>
  Unlike conventional cellular automata (e.g. Conway's Game of Life TODO link), which base a cell's state on every neighbouring cell,
  block automata only look at some of the neighbours in each step.
  These block automata divide the grid into 2&times;2 blocks, and
  calculate the new state of a block at a time.
  Cells in a block can depend on other cells in that block, but not on any cells outside the block.
</p>
<p>
  By using different blocks in alternating steps, effects can still
  spread across the whole field.
</p>
<p>
  Block cellular automata like this are good at modelling conserved
  properties, like mass. If the update rule doesn't change the total
  mass of a block, then the total mass in the whole world must
  remain the same.

  <p>
    This automaton shows something like water or gas flooding
    through a space.
    Cells take values from 0 to 8, and the update rule sets all
    cells in a block to the average value of the block;
    so the total mass in the system tries to spread out evenly.
